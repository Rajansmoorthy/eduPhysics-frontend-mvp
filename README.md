eduPhysics Frontend MVP

This repository contains the **frontend-only MVP** for **eduPhysics AI**.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the **user interface, user flow, and educational intent** of the eduPhysics platform for students, teachers, and school partners.

This MVP does **not** include real AI integration and does **not** make any external API calls.

🎯 Objectives

- Demonstrate the look and feel of the eduPhysics platform
- Validate student and teacher user journeys
- Support early discussions with CBSE schools and institutions
- Collect feedback before backend or AI integration
